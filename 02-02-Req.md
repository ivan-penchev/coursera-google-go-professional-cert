# Course 2 - Functions, Methods, and Interfaces in Go - Week 2
## Goal
The goal of this assignment is to create a routine that solves a linear kinematics problem.

## Requirements
Let us assume the following formula for
displacement **s** as a function of time **t**, acceleration **a**, initial velocity **v0**,
and initial displacement **s0**.

So the formula would be:
s = 0.5 a t^2 + v0t + s0

Write a program which first prompts the user to enter values for acceleration, initial velocity, and initial displacement.

Then the program should prompt the user to enter a value for time and the program should compute the displacement after the entered time.

You will need to define and use a function
called **GenDisplaceFn()** which takes three float64
arguments, acceleration a, initial velocity v0, and initial
displacement s0. 

**GenDisplaceFn()** should return a function which computes displacement as a function of time, assuming the given values acceleration, initial velocity, and initial displacement. 
The function returned by **GenDisplaceFn() ** should take one float64 argument t, representing time, and return one float64 argument which is the displacement travelled after time t.

For example, letâ€™s say that I want to assume the following values for acceleration, initial velocity, and initial displacement: a = 10, v0 = 2, s0 = 1. I can use the following statement to call GenDisplaceFn() to generate a function fn which will compute displacement as a function of time.

*fn := GenDisplaceFn(10, 2, 1)*

Then I can use the following statement to print the displacement after 3 seconds.

*fmt.Println(fn(3))*

And I can use the following statement to print the displacement after 5 seconds.
*
fmt.Println(fn(5))*
